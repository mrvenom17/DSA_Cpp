Queues Data Structures

Queues are a type of container adaptors which operate in a first in first out (FIFO) type of arrangement.
Elements are inserted at the back (end) and are deleted from the front. 


Operations on Queue:
1. Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue.
2. Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue.
3. Front: Get the front item from queue.
4. Rear: Get the last item from queue.
5. isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
6. isFull: Checks if the queue is full.


Applications of Queue:
1. CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
2. Buffering
3. Event Handling
